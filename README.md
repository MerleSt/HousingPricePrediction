# Housing Prices Prediction Challenge 🏠
Welcome to the repository for the Housing Prices Prediction Challenge! 🎉

## Overview 🌐
This repository contains all the code and resources related to the Kaggle competition where the goal was to predict housing prices. Through extensive research and the guidance of an insightful YouTube tutorial, we achieved a spot in the top 5% of the competition! 🥳

## Overview & How it Works 🌐⚙️
This repository contains all the code and resources related to the Kaggle competition where the objective was to predict housing prices. With diligent research and guidance from an invaluable YouTube tutorial, we secured a position in the top 5%!

The notebook follows these comprehensive steps:

1. Data Cleaning 🧽: Ensures the data is pristine. This includes handling missing values, ensuring proper data types, and more.
2. Feature Engineering 🔧: A process of enhancing the dataset by building upon existing features and creating new ones.
3. Feature Transformations 🔄: Correcting skewed numeric values and applying cosine transformations to cyclical features.
4. Encoding 🔄: Categorical data is transformed into a numeric format using one-hot encoding.
5. Scaling ⚖️: Keeping features on a similar scale using StandardScaler.
6. Target Transformations 🎯: Applying logarithmic transformations on the SalePrice target variable.
7. Model Selection 🤖: Using pycaret to evaluate and determine the best-performing models.
8. Hyperparameter Optimization 🔍: Fine-tuning model parameters using optuna for best results.
9. Ensembling 🧩: Averaging predictions from different models to yield a final, more robust prediction.
10. Future Considerations ➡️: Ideas around feature selection for potential improvements.

## Important Note ⚠️
⏳ The notebook is comprehensive and can take a considerable amount of time to run completely. Please be patient and ensure you have the necessary computational resources available.
